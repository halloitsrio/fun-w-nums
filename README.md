Authors : Ria Kanwar & Shreya Shingare

Requirements :
- Write a program with a main method 
- Create at least one new method which is called from main that takes at least one parameter 
- Call at least two distinct methods in the String class 
- Utilize conditional statements or compound Boolean expressions 
- Utilize iteration

Function : This program asks the user which of the 4 possible functions they would like to use (prime number, odd or even, LCM, or GCF). After that, the user is asked for specific parameters, and if the input does not meet the reqirement, the user will be asked to input the parameter (or even when choosing which function to use) repeaatedly until completed properly. Then this will loop back to the start and ask which function they want to use, unless the close the entire program by typing the key words given in the instructions at the beginning.

Definitions :

isPrime(int num) - prints whether the num is prime or not
oddEven(int num) - prints whether the num is odd or even
lcm(int num) - prints the lcm of the num
gcf(int num) - prints the gcf of the num
